## üìå Assignment Overview

You will build a **two-page frontend application** with a simple UI using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application does not need to connect to an API, but it must be **functional with dummy data**.

**Keep in mind the pages have very simple UI elements; feel free to improve the deisgn language and introduce any new elements you like**

### ‚ú® Requirements

You need to implement the following pages:

#### **1. Login Page**

- Accepts **email and password** for login.
- Provides options for **SSO login** (UI only).
- Includes options to **change password** and **create a new user** (the ‚Äúcreate a new user‚Äù button should redirect to a new page, which can be empty).

#### **2. Home Page**

- **Left section** (smaller area)
  - Displays a **simple chatbot UI** (like ChatGPT-style chat).
  - It **does not need to be functional**, but should contain **dummy messages**.
- **Right section** (larger area)
  - Simply displays an **embedded PDF file** within the UI. You can find an example pdf in `src/resources/sample.pdf`. Its your job to figure out whats the best way to embed it.

#### **3. Additional UI Component (Your Choice)**

To showcase your **technical skill and creativity**, create at least **one UI element of your choice**.  
Here are a few examples:

- A fully designed **"Create User" page**.
- A **loading animation or transition** when navigating between pages.
- A **theme switcher** (light/dark mode).
- Any **unique UI enhancement** that improves the user experience. The more creative the better!
